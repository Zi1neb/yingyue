<FONT COLOR="gold"><h1><i><u>Moroccan kaftan</u></i></h1></font>
<p>Morocco is characterized by several traditional clothes such as: <ul> <li> The Djellaba; <li> The Kaftan or Caftan; <li>The Takchita; <li> The Haik; <li> The Gandoura; <li> The Deraa; <li> The Qandrissi trousers. </u>
</ul><p>And today we will talk about Kaftan:</P>
<p><b>Moroccan kaftan</b> is a traditional Moroccan outfit. In the form of a long tunic, in general with long sleeves, worn with a belt <a href="https://www.rafinity.co.ma/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pr%C3%A9cieusement-sertie.jpg"target="_blank"><i>(mdama)</i></a> which can be extended under a lot of styles and colors. The Moroccan kaftan results from the expertise of craftsmen and dressmakers. Under Amazigh influence and Andalusian cultures, it has become a part of the booming Moroccan textile sector, which accounts for 30% of the country's industrial employment and 15% of its exports.</p>
<p>It is considered to be the ultimate formal attire for Moroccan women during ceremonies (weddings, baptisms, religious festivals). Moroccan stylists have modernized the traditional kaftan by adapting it to the particularities of the current era. The Moroccan kaftan has gained popularity after being introduced by major clothing lines, and stylists, through prestigious fashion shows, such as the Oriental Fashion Show during "Fashions week " around the world; as well as the promotion work of Moroccan magazines like "Femmes du Maroc" (Moroccan Ladies).</p>
<p>Nowadays, the Moroccan kaftan popularity has exceeded the country's borders. It is exported in large quantities abroad.</P>
